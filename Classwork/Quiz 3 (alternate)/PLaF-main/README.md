# Programming Language Fundamentals

These notes and accompanying OCaml source code take a hands-on
approach in introducing fundamental programming language concepts. 

You will need to install:
* opam: the package manage for OCaml. Follow instructions here: https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html
* ocaml: the language we use as host for implementing our interpreters. Follow the instructions here: https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html
* menhir: the lexer and parser generator.  Just type `opam install menhir`
* ounit: the unit testting library. Just type `opam install ounit2`
